	ABSTRACT={Many applied problems arising in agricultural monitoring and food security require reliable crop maps at national or global scale. Large scale crop mapping requires processing and management of large amount of heterogeneous satellite imagery acquired by various sensors that consequently leads to a “Big Data” problem. The main objective of this study is to explore efficiency of using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform when classifying multi-temporal satellite imagery with potential to apply the platform for a larger scale (e.g. country level) and multiple sensors (e.g. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). In particular, multiple state-of-the-art classifiers available in the GEE platform are compared to produce a high resolution (30 m) crop classification map for a large territory (~28,100 km2 and 1.0 M ha of cropland). Though this study does not involve large volumes of data, it does address efficiency of the GEE platform to effectively execute complex workflows of satellite data processing required with large scale applications such as crop mapping. The study discusses strengths and weaknesses of classifiers, assesses accuracies that can be achieved with different classifiers for the Ukrainian landscape, and compares them to the benchmark classifier using a neural network approach that was developed in our previous studies. The study is carried out for the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) test site in Ukraine covering the Kyiv region (North of Ukraine) in 2013. We found that Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides very good performance in terms of enabling access to the remote sensing products through the cloud platform and providing pre-processing; however, in terms of classification accuracy, the neural network based approach outperformed support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and random forest classifiers available in GEE.}

	abstract="Site-specific crop management is a promising approach to maximize crop yield with optimal use of rapidly depleting natural resources. Availability of high resolution crop data at critical growth stages is a key for real-time data-driven decisions during the production season. The goal of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using small unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based remote sensing technologies to monitor the crop stress of irrigated pinto beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with varied irrigation and tillage treatments. A small UAS with onboard multispectral and infrared thermal imaging sensors was used to collect data from bean field plots on three growth stages in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Indicators including green normalized vegetation index (GNDVI), canopy cover (CC, ratio of ground covered by crop canopy to the total plot area) and canopy temperature (CT, {\textdegree}C) of crops were extracted from imaging data and correlated with ground-reference crop yield and leaf area index (LAI) estimated with a handheld ceptometer. Results show that GNDVI, CC and CT were able to differentiate crops with full and deficit irrigation treatments at each of the three growth stages in both years. Developed indicators were strongly correlated with to the crop yield with Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of approximate 0.71 and 0.72 for GNDVI and CC, respectively, in the early growth stage (54 days after planting) in both years. Canopy temperature showed even stronger correlation (r > 0.8) with yield at early growth stage. Performance of small UAS-based imagery-based indicators in crop stress monitoring and crop yield estimation was better than or comparable to that of the ground-based LAI estimates, indicating the potential of such remote sensing tool in rapid crop stress monitoring and management.",

	abstract="Cruciferous weeds are competitive broad-leaved species that cause losses in winter crops. In the present study, research on remote sensing was conducted on seven naturally infested fields located in C{\'o}rdoba and Seville, southern Spain. Multi-spectral aerial images (four bands, including blue (B), green (G), red (R) and near-infrared bands) taken in April 2007 were used to evaluate the feasibility of mapping cruciferous patches (Diplotaxis spp. and Sinapis spp.) in winter crops (wheat, broad bean and pea) and compare the accuracy of different supervised classification methods (vegetation indices, maximum likelihood and spectral angle mapper). The best classification method was selected to develop site-specific cruciferous treatment maps. Cruciferous patches were efficiently discriminated with red/blue (R/B) and blue/green (B/G) vegetation indices and the maximum likelihood classifier. At all of the locations, the accuracy of the results obtained from the spectral angler mapper was relatively low. The cruciferous weed-classified imagery of each location were created according to the method that provided the best discrimination results and were used to obtain site-specific treatment maps for in-season post-emergence control measures or herbicide applications for subsequent years. By applying the site-specific treatment maps, herbicide savings from 71.7 to 95.4{\%} for the no-treatment areas and from 4.3 to 12{\%} for the low-dose herbicide were obtained.",

	doi = {10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2517118},
	abstract = {This paper presents a time-weighted version of the dynamic time warping ({DTW}) method for land-use and land-cover classification using remote sensing image time series. Methods based on {DTW} have achieved significant results in time-series data mining. The original {DTW} method works well for shape matching, but is not suited for remote sensing time-series classification. It disregards the temporal range when finding the best alignment between two time series. Since each land-cover class has a specific phenological cycle, a good time-series land-cover classifier needs to balance between shape matching and temporal alignment. To that end, we adjusted the original {DTW} method to include a temporal weight that accounts for seasonality of land-cover types. The resulting algorithm improves on previous methods for land-cover classification using {DTW}. In a case study in a tropical forest area, our proposed logistic time-weighted version achieves the best overall accuracy of 87.32\%. The accuracy of a version with maximum time delay constraints is 84.66\%. A time-warping method without time constraints has a 70.14\% accuracy. To get good results with the proposed algorithm, the spatial and temporal resolutions of the data should capture the properties of the landscape. The pattern samples should also represent well the temporal variation of land cover.},

	abstract = {Land cover classification ({LCC}) is a central and wide field of research in earth observation and has already put forth a variety of classification techniques. Many approaches are based on classification techniques considering observation at certain points in time. However, some land cover classes, such as crops, change their spectral characteristics due to environmental influences and can thus not be monitored effectively with classical mono-temporal approaches. Nevertheless, these temporal observations should be utilized to benefit the classification process. After extensive research has been conducted on modeling temporal dynamics by spectro-temporal profiles using vegetation indices, we propose a deep learning approach to utilize these temporal characteristics for classification tasks. In this work, we show how long short-term memory ({LSTM}) neural networks can be employed for crop identification purposes with {SENTINEL} 2A observations from large study areas and label information provided by local authorities. We compare these temporal neural network models, i.e., {LSTM} and recurrent neural network ({RNN}), with a classical non-temporal convolutional neural network ({CNN}) model and an additional support vector machine ({SVM}) baseline. With our rather straightforward {LSTM} variant, we exceeded state-of-the-art classification performance, thus opening promising potential for further research.},

	abstract = {Currently, accurate information on crop area coverage is vital for food security and industry, and there is strong demand for timely crop mapping. In this study, we used {MODIS} time series data to investigate the effect of the time series length on crop mapping. Eight time series with different lengths (ranging from one month to eight months) were tested. For each time series, we first used the Random Forest ({RF}) algorithm to calculate the importance score for all features (including multi-spectral data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}), Normalized Difference Water Index ({NDWI}), and phenological metrics). Subsequently, an extension of the Jeffries-Matusita ({JM}) distance was used to measure class separability for each time series. Finally, the {RF} algorithm was used to classify crop types, and the classification accuracy and certainty were used to analyze the influence of the time series length and the number of features on classification performance; the features were added one by one based on their importance scores. Results indicated that when the time series was longer than five months, the top ten features remained stable. These features were mainly in July and August. In addition, the {NDVI} features contributed the majority of the most significant features for crop mapping. The {NDWI} and data from multi-spectral bands also contributed to improving crop mapping. On the other hand, separability, classification accuracy, and certainty increased with the number of features used and the time series length, although these values quickly reached saturation. Five months was the optimal time series length, as longer time series provided no further improvement in the classification performance. This result shows that relatively short time series have the potential to identify crops accurately, which allows for early crop mapping over large areas.},
