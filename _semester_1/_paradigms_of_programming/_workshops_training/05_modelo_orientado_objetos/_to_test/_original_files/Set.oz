% Simple set operations

% This is the Set module, which defines operations on sets
% represented as unordered lists.  The operations are set union
% (Union), set intersection (Inter), and set difference (Minus).
% These operations take time proportional to the product of the
% argument sizes.  They work with sets of any values represented
% as lists containing the values in any order.
